# **Stock Price Prediction**

## **1. Understanding the Dataset**
The dataset consists of historical stock prices with **daily market data**. The goal is to predict future stock prices based on past trends.

### **Dataset Structure**
- **Date**: The trading date.
- **Open**: The stock's opening price on a given day.
- **High**: The highest price reached during the day.
- **Low**: The lowest price reached during the day.
- **Close**: The stock's closing price.
- **Adj Close**: Adjusted closing price, accounting for dividends and stock splits.
- **Volume**: The total number of shares traded.

## **2. Data Preprocessing**
To prepare the dataset for model training, the following steps are taken:

### **A. Handling Missing Values**
- Check for missing or `NaN` values in stock prices.
- **Strategy:** Forward-fill or interpolate missing values.

### **B. Date Processing**
- Convert the **Date** column into a `datetime` format.
- Set **Date** as the index for time-series analysis.

### **C. Feature Engineering**
- **Moving Averages**: Compute **5-day, 10-day, and 50-day moving averages**.
- **Volatility Measures**: Calculate rolling **standard deviation**.
- **Momentum Indicators**: Include **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** and **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**.

---

## **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
### **A. Time-Series Visualization**
- **Line Plots**: Show trends in stock prices over time.
- **Rolling Mean Plots**: Display smoothed trends.
- **Volume Analysis**: Identify spikes in trading activity.

### **B. Correlation Analysis**
- **Correlation heatmap**: Identify relationships between stock metrics.
- **Lag Analysis**: Assess how past stock prices influence future trends.

## **4. Predictive Modeling**
### **A. Models Used**
- **Linear Regression** (Baseline model)
- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks)**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

### **B. Model Training & Evaluation**
- Split the dataset into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** subsets.
- Evaluate models using:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
  - **R-Squared Score**

---

## **5. Insights & Financial Implications**
- **What factors influence stock price movements?**
  - Trends in moving averages and volume spikes.
- **Can past prices predict future trends?**
  - Model performance indicates if stock price movements are predictable.
- **How can this be used in trading strategies?**
  - Identifying **entry and exit points** based on trend analysis.

## **6. Next Steps**
- Fine-tune **hyperparameters** for better predictions.
- Integrate **news sentiment analysis** to enhance forecasting.
- Expand analysis to **multiple stocks** for portfolio predictions.
